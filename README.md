# NagarIQ: Real-time AI-Powered City Monitoring App
## Overview
NagarIQ is an innovative, real-time AI-powered city monitoring application designed to centralize and synthesize scattered urban data into a clean, actionable, and map-based interface. Built with a mobile-first approach, NagarIQ collects live data from diverse sources—including user-submitted forms, news sites, traffic APIs, and social media—and intelligently fuses them into a single, intelligent city dashboard using Google's Gemini AI.

Problem Solved: Cities generate an overwhelming amount of data from various disconnected sources. This data overload makes it challenging for citizens and authorities to get a clear, real-time understanding of urban issues, leading to delayed responses and inefficiency. NagarIQ addresses this by filtering noise, delivering clear updates, and providing predictive insights.

## Features
NagarIQ offers a comprehensive suite of features to keep citizens informed and empower them to contribute to city management:

User Reporting Forms: Citizens can easily submit geo-tagged photos, videos, or detailed text descriptions about local city events or issues (e.g., potholes, flooding, fallen trees) directly via the mobile app.

AI-Powered Multimodal Event Detection: Images and videos submitted by users or scraped from social media are automatically tagged, described, and mapped using Gemini Vision APIs, providing rich contextual information.

News Scraping Engine: A robust backend system pulls local news headlines and civic updates from various news websites, feeding them to Gemini AI for real-time summarization.

Social Media Scraper & Sentiment Analysis: Tracks city-specific hashtags and geo-relevant posts from platforms like X (formerly Twitter) to detect emerging events, public sentiment, and trending concerns. Gemini's language models convert raw social data into structured insights.

Real-time Traffic Data: Integrates with Google Maps Platform APIs to provide live congestion updates and suggest alternate routes, displayed directly on the map dashboard.

AI-Powered Summaries & Data Fusion: Gemini AI intelligently fuses multiple data points (e.g., numerous tweets about a single incident) into concise, clean, and actionable alerts, reducing information overload.

Predictive Alerts: By analyzing patterns across clustered reports, social media spikes, and other data, the system can detect potential escalations and send early warnings to relevant users.

Live Map Dashboard: An interactive city map serving as the central hub, featuring filters for different data types (reports, news, traffic), dynamic markers, and potentially "mood map" overlays reflecting public sentiment.

Personalized Notifications: Users receive push notifications for relevant alerts and updates, potentially tailored to their location and interests.

User Authentication: Secure sign-up and login for citizens to submit reports and access personalized features.

## Technical Stack
NagarIQ leverages a modern, scalable, and AI-first technology stack primarily based on Google Cloud Platform and Firebase.

### Frontend (Mobile App):

React Native (Expo): For cross-platform mobile application development, enabling rapid prototyping and deployment without emulators (via Expo Go).

Google Maps SDK (via Google Maps Platform): For interactive map display, geo-tagging, and traffic overlays.

Firebase SDK: For seamless integration with Firebase services (Authentication, Firestore, Cloud Storage, Cloud Messaging).

### Backend & Cloud Infrastructure:

Firebase Firestore: A NoSQL cloud database for real-time storage and synchronization of all application data (user reports, news summaries, social media insights, alerts).

Firebase Cloud Functions: Serverless functions triggered by events (e.g., new report submission, scheduled scraping) to handle backend logic, interact with AI APIs, and manage data.

Firebase Cloud Storage: For storing large media files like user-submitted photos and videos.

Firebase Authentication: For secure user management (sign-up, login).

Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM): For sending push notifications to mobile devices.

Cloud Run / Virtual Machine (VM): For deploying and scaling scraping agents (Python scripts for news and social media).

Cloud Pub/Sub: (Optional, for advanced ingestion) A messaging service for asynchronous communication between different parts of the system, especially for high-volume data ingestion.

BigQuery: A fully managed, serverless data warehouse for advanced analytics, storing historical data, and enabling complex queries for predictive modeling.

### AI/ML Intelligence:

Gemini API (via Vertex AI): The core AI engine for:

Gemini Pro (Text): Text summarization (news, social media), categorization of user reports, sentiment analysis.

Gemini Multimodal / Vision APIs: Image and video analysis (auto-tagging, description generation, object detection) from user uploads and social media.

Vertex AI Workbench / Pipelines: (For advanced AI workflows) Managed Jupyter Notebook environments and MLOps tools for developing, deploying, and orchestrating machine learning models, especially for predictive analytics.

### Geo-mapping:

Google Maps Platform: Provides the underlying map services, APIs for geo-coding, routing, and traffic data.

GeoJSON: A format for encoding geographic data structures, useful for storing and displaying complex map features.

Google Places API: (If needed) For searching and displaying information about specific places.

### Deployment & Monitoring:

Firebase Hosting: For deploying web-based components (if any, though primarily mobile-focused).

Cloud Logging & Monitoring (Cloud Operations Suite): For comprehensive logging, monitoring application performance, and setting up alerts.

Architecture Overview
The NagarIQ architecture follows a modular, event-driven design to ensure scalability and real-time responsiveness:

Mobile App (Frontend): The React Native application serves as the primary user interface. It interacts with Firebase services for authentication, data submission, and real-time updates.

### Data Ingestion:

User Reports: Submitted directly from the mobile app to Firebase Firestore and Cloud Storage.

External Data (News, Social Media, Traffic): Dedicated scraping agents (Python scripts on Cloud Run/VM) periodically fetch data from news websites, social media platforms, and Google Maps APIs.

Backend Processing (Cloud Functions & AI Orchestration):

Event Triggers: Firebase Cloud Functions are triggered by new data (e.g., a new report in Firestore, a scheduled event for scraping).

AI Integration: These functions act as orchestrators, sending raw data to Gemini APIs (via Vertex AI) for processing (summarization, categorization, image analysis, sentiment analysis).

Data Transformation: Processed data is then structured and stored back into Firestore.

Real-time Synchronization: Firestore's real-time listeners ensure that the mobile app's map dashboard and alerts feed are continuously updated as new data becomes available.

Notifications: Firebase Cloud Messaging sends push notifications to users based on new alerts or predictive insights.

Data Analytics (BigQuery): All processed and raw data can be streamed or exported to BigQuery for historical analysis, trend detection, and training predictive models.
